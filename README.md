# PyGerritAPI Application

This project is a Flask-based web application that interfaces with the native Gerrit REST API. It provides endpoints to fetch information about users, projects, and changes from the Gerrit server and presents them through a simple retro-themed web interface.

## Features

- List all active Gerrit users and compare them to a CSV list of AD employees.
- Retrieve and display Gerrit projects.
- Fetch and display open changes in Gerrit.
- Retro-themed web interface for a nostalgic user experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
```
git clone https://github.com/SG6714/pygerrit.git
cd pygerrit
```


2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
It’s a good practice to use a virtual environment for Python projects.
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```


3. **Install Dependencies**
Install the required Python packages using pip.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


4. **Set Environment Variables**
Create a .env file or set these variables in your environment:
```
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
GERRIT_URL=your_gerrit_url:port
GERRIT_USERNAME=your_gerrit_username
GERRIT_PASSWORD=your_gerrit_password
FLASK_ENV=development  # Set to 'production' for production environment
```


## Running the Application

### Start the Flask App
Run the following command to start the Flask development server:
```
python app.py
```
> By default, the app will be available at http://localhost:5000.


### Access the Application

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5000 to access the retro-themed dashboard.
